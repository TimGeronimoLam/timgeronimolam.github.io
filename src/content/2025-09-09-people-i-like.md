description: To start up my blog, I would like to talk about people who inspire me. Those are people whose opinions have shaped mine and who I value as web developers because they focus on the core principles of the web.

This post also gives you a sense of what to expect here. Since I like these people, naturally my opinions will fall in a similar direction. By the way, the list is not sorted in any way and definitely incomplete, but let's just _delve in_.

## [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com)

Chris is all about building fast, resilient, and accessible websites. He does this by using vanilla JS to progressively enhance websites and by keeping its use to a minimum.

According to him, most websites or even web apps don't really need a big framework like React, which would only result in shipping way too much JavaScript down the wire. This is especially detrimental in places with poor internet connectivity.

I also love that he is sharing a lot of his personal opinions outside of web development. He is a proponent of a "weird web," like in the beginning of the internet, and openly talks about his favorite songs, his morals, and what it's like to live with ADHD as a developer.

> Give me weird. Give me personal. Talk about more than just "your focus." I want to hear about music and art and what you’re reading and your hobbies and travels.

## [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com)

When I recently tried to fill my newsletter with as many web people as possible, I stumbled upon Sara Soueidan. The first thing that struck me is her mindset about design: it's ultimately about people. That thought comes with some consequences: **the web is for everyone, so leave no one behind**.

This is the reason she focuses so much on accessibility and--I think--the reason why you should, too.

Sara also has a talent for breaking down complex ideas into easy-to-understand articles. Her writing has already helped me a lot, and I find myself going back to it again and again.

## [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net)

I can't write this article without mentioning one of my biggest personal legends. Back in 2012, while still in high school, I started getting into web design. Chris Coyier was the first web person I really followed. Over the years, I watched his YouTube videos, listened to his podcast, and read his articles, learning a lot along the way.

These days I don't follow him as closely and I'm not even sure why. Maybe it's because his content is rather broad, while I'm currently more drawn to diving deeper into specific topics like accessibility or web components. Still, I'm grateful for the early inspiration he gave me.

These are just a few people who have shaped my thinking. I hope that by sharing them here, you've discovered someone new, whether that's one of the people above, or even a little bit of me through the people I like.
