Before diving into the more technical stuff, I want to set the tone. I’m writing primarily for *myself*--I find that explaining something in a post helps me understand it better. If others find value in it too, that’s a bonus.

Be warned: opinions might change, and approaches might turn out to be wrong. That’s okay. This blog is about *learning*, and learning works best in a **community**. If you ever feel obliged to write a response to one of my posts, I’d love to hear from you. For now, that means email or social media, but a comment section might follow when it feels right.

## Topics you can expect

- **Using the web as it was intended**: Embracing native browser features, progressive enhancement, and simplicity.
- **Web components**: I’m constantly struggling with how to feel about them. They definitely have their place but shouldn’t be used for everything.
- **Short learnings**: Small insights and solutions from my daily work that are quick to read, and hopefully useful.

That’s it for now. Thanks for reading and welcome to the blog!
